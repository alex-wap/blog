I'm currently an engineer at Yahoo! Bangalore. I build systems to rapidly detect real-world
events, like earthquakes and celebrity deaths, from various sources on the web. I work with
systems like [Storm](http://storm-project.net) and [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org) to power
streaming [language models](http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2010/proceedings/docs/p11.pdf). I
find this blend of science and engineering exciting, and the challenges of executing it at
scale very satisfying.
