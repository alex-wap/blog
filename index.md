I'm a first-year masters student in the [InfoCloud][1] research group at [KAUST][2],
advised by [Panos Kalnis][3].

My research studies the objectives and constraints that drive user behavior in
social networks, and designs algorithms to discover optimal behavior in this
setting. I am broadly interested in social, economic, game and graph theory.
I use methods from machine learning to fit and validate my models.

I was a software engineer on the *Timesense* team at [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com/)!
till 2013, and a computer science undergraduate at [BITS - Pilani Goa Campus][4]
from 2008 to 2012.

I write a [blog](/blog/) and can be contacted via
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/emaadmanzoor) or
[email](mailto:emaadahmed.manzoor@kaust.edu.sa).
A verbose account of stuff I've worked on is [here](/about/).
