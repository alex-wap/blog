I am a first-year PhD student at [Stony Brook University][9] working with
[Leman Akoglu][10] on detecting anomalies in graph-structured data.

I received my master's degree from [KAUST][2], where I worked with
[Panos Kalnis][3] on [scheduling broadcasts][11] in social networks with timelines.

In a previous life, I was a software engineer at [Yahoo!][6] where I was fortunate to
work with the [Timesense](/yahoo/) team. Before that, I was an undergraduate at
[BITS - Pilani, Goa Campus][4].
