A Social Network, literally. The image above is my Facebook social  graph; with my friends, my friends of friends and so on as the  vertices connected by edges representing their Facebook friendships, limited only by members' individual privacy  options. You can click on it (a better idea would be to right-click and then do a "Save Link As") to open a 32MB ultra high-res .png file  where you can actually zoom in to read the names and stuff.

The  graph's split up into dense clusters of friends, corresponding to my current college, junior college and school. An interesting thing I noticed was<strong> Varun Vaswani, Chinmay Deshpande, Kunal Bhatia and Prashant  Sriram </strong>happen to be my <strong>bridge vertices</strong>; if all four of you somehow just  disappeared, or never existed, there would be no connection between my  Facebook friends at Goa (The bottom BITS Goa cluster) and at Bangalore (the top-left Deeksha cluster and the top-right VNS cluster). I guess we're all special and indispensable to each other in some way.
