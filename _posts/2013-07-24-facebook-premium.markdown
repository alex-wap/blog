Everybody thinks because I'm one of the Twitter guys that I must be good at using all social media. The truth is, if I can't figure an app out in a minute, I usually move on to something else. Too many settings and options frustrate and confuse me. I like making simple stuff because I enjoy simple stuff.

This stuff won't appear in the excerpt.

When Facebook first came out, I signed up as soon as I could. Then I made the mistake of heedlessly accepting every incoming request until my account was so busy I couldnâ€™t keep up. On top of that, Facebook added thousands of settings, features, and choices. Whenever I tried to get back into it, I became overwhelmed.

However, now that some former Facebook employees work with me at my new startup, Jelly, Iâ€™m using Facebook. Camille actually leaned over my shoulder and helped me go through every setting to simplify my Facebook experience on iPhone. Now Iâ€™m keeping up with friends and family on Facebook like a billion other people.

People love Facebook. They really love it. My mother-in-law looks hypnotized when she decides to put in some Facebook time. In general, the ads on Facebook donâ€™t seem particularly useful or engaging. However, ads on the service are universally tolerated because thatâ€™s what makes Facebook free and free is nice.

Anywhoo, now that Iâ€™m using it and thinking about it, Iâ€™ve got an idea for Facebook. They could offer Facebook Premium. For $10 a month, people who really love Facebook (and can afford it), could see no ads. Maybe some special features too. If 10% percent of Facebook signed up, thatâ€™s $1B a month in revenue. Not too shabby.

Itâ€™s a different type of company, but by way of validation, have a look at Pandoraâ€™s 1Q14 financial results. Of all Pandoraâ€™s revenue generators, the highest growth year-over-year by far (114% growth rate) is in subscriptionsâ€”people paying a monthly fee for an ad-free experience. So there you have it. â€œFuck yeah.â€ Right?
