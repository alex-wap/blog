<p>I guess I wouldn't, with Foreheads just around the corner! This tiny app sits on your desktop, letting you post sticky notes on your "Forehead". The cool thing is, so can your Mom! Via the internet and a unique Headprint for your Forehead, anyone can post a sticky on your Forehead and watch its status.</p>
