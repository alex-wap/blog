   * [Manufacturing Consent](http://www.amazon.com/Manufacturing-Consent-Political-Economy-Media/dp/0375714499), Noam Chomsky.

Summary from [alternet](http://www.alternet.org/media/noam-chomsky-why-internet-hasnt-freed-our-minds-propaganda-continues-dominate):

> In “Manufacturing Consent,” Noam Chomsky posits that Western corporate media is structurally bound to “manufacture consent” in the interests of dominant, elite groups in society. With “filters” which determine what gets to become ‘news’ – including media ownership, advertising, and “flak”, he shows how propaganda can pervade the “free” media in an ostensibly democratic Western society through self-censorship.
