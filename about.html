I'm currently a software systems engineer at Yahoo! Bangalore, where I build systems to
quickly detect real-world events, like earthquakes and celebrity deaths, from various sources
of user-generated content on the web. This is an interesting blend of science and engineering
at scale, where I work with [Storm](http://storm-project.net) and [Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org)
to power streaming [language models](http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2010/proceedings/docs/p11.pdf).
